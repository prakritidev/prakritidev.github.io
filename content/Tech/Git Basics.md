## What is Git ? 

Official Definition is its a distributed version control. To those who are in college or maybe in school or maybe who is just starting in tech, the eaiser way to understand it. Its a tool where it can store multiple versions of your files or a single file. It maintains the history for all the changes you have done. Not only that it can also keep different versions of you file exist in same directory. It gives us the power of looking back into the past and keep the directory clean. 

So, its better to use git rather than naming the you files like "final.txt", "final1.txt", "final_final.txt"

In order to get that ability to look into the past. you have you create a folder or directory where you need this power. 

Ofcourse you need to install it first. Just look at any installation videos or ask chatGPT for it. 

## Git init 

`git init`

open the terminal in the folder you created. or maybe `cd` to the directory you created and run the above command. 

This will initialise the a git repository and a hidden .git folder is created in it. 

## Git add





## Git Commit
