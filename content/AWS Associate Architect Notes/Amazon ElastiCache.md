## **Amazon ElastiCache** 

  

Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that simplifies the setup and management of distributed in-memory caching environments. This service makes it easy and cost effective to provide a high-performance and scalable caching solution for your cloud applications. You can use Amazon ElastiCache in your applications to speed the deployment of cache clusters and reduce the administration required for a distributed cache environment. 

  

  

  

**Data Access Patterns** 

  

  

Retrieving a flat key from an in-memory cache will always be faster than the most optimized database query. You should evaluate the access pattern of the data before you decide to store it in cache. 

  

  

**Cache Engines**

  

Amazon ElastiCache allows you to quickly deploy clusters of two different types of popular cache engines: Memcached and Redis. At a high level, Memcached and Redis may seem similar, but they support a variety of different use cases and provide different functionality.
