### Project Overview: Building a System for Consistent Daily Profits

The goal of this project is to explore the feasibility of building a system that can consistently achieve an average daily profit of 1%. Although it is widely recognized that this task is practically impossible due to the generally efficient nature of financial markets, the project serves as a valuable learning experience. Key areas of focus include:

1. **Understanding Time Series Data:**
   - Learning how to handle and analyze time series data, which is critical for financial modeling and forecasting.

2. **Data Handling and Processing:**
   - Exploring techniques for managing large datasets, including data cleaning, transformation, and normalization.

3. **Database Selection:**
   - Investigating different databases to determine which are best suited for storing and querying financial data efficiently.

4. **Portfolio Selection:**
   - Learning how to select a diversified portfolio of assets to optimize returns and manage risk.

5. **Risk Management:**
   - Implementing strategies to minimize losses and protect capital, including stop-loss orders, position sizing, and diversification.

While the primary objective may be ambitious, the knowledge and skills gained through this project will be invaluable for understanding the complexities of financial markets and quantitative trading.
