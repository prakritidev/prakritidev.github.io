# **Portfolio Building for Limited Capital: Clustering Market Data Approach**

---

**Introduction**
In portfolio management, particularly when dealing with limited capital, it's crucial to focus on creating an efficient strategy for selecting and allocating assets. A top-down portfolio-building approach is useful for managing a large universe of assets, especially when the available capital restricts direct exposure to all assets. By clustering assets and forming groups with similar characteristics, it becomes feasible to optimize portfolio allocations and manage risks effectively.

---

**1. Problem Statement**

The challenge is building an efficient portfolio from a large set of equities (e.g., 4000+) when capital is limited. Direct allocation to each equity is not feasible due to:
- Limited capital
- High transaction costs
- Risk diversification concerns

Thus, grouping similar assets and focusing on clusters helps simplify portfolio construction.

---

**2. The Top-Down Approach**

In the context of portfolio construction, a top-down approach involves:
- **Step 1**: Identifying the broad asset groups (clusters) to focus on.
- **Step 2**: Allocating capital within these groups based on risk, return, and market conditions.
- **Step 3**: Refining the allocation within each group based on individual asset characteristics.

**Benefits of this approach**:
- Reduces the complexity of selecting individual assets from a pool of 4000+ equities.
- Allows for diversification while managing capital limitations.
- Enables easier risk management and portfolio optimization.

**3. Clustering Market Data**

To build a portfolio, you first need to cluster market data based on asset similarities. The following steps are essential for clustering:

- **Data Preparation**: 
  - Gather time-series data (OHLCV, returns, volatility, etc.) for all equities.
  - Clean and preprocess the data for consistent formatting and missing values handling.
  - Normalize the data (returns, price levels, volatility) to ensure comparability across assets.
  
- **Feature Engineering**: 
  - Calculate returns (daily, weekly, monthly).
  - Derive volatility (standard deviation of returns over a rolling window).
  - Calculate moving averages (simple and exponential).
  
- **Clustering Algorithms**:
  - Use unsupervised learning methods such as K-Means, DBSCAN, or Hierarchical Clustering to group similar stocks based on their behavior (price movements, volatility).
  - Determine the optimal number of clusters using techniques like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score.

**4. Building the Portfolio**

Once you have clustered the assets, you can proceed with the portfolio construction:

- **Group Allocation**: 
  - Allocate capital to each cluster based on risk, return, and the overall economic environment.
  - Diversification can be achieved by holding assets from multiple clusters.

- **Risk Management**:
  - Calculate the risk (volatility, drawdown) and ensure the portfolioâ€™s overall risk level is within acceptable limits.
  - Apply concepts like Value at Risk (VaR) to ensure portfolio protection.

- **Capital Allocation within Clusters**:
  - If capital is limited, allocate more to the clusters that offer higher risk-adjusted returns, or those that are expected to outperform the market based on historical data or sentiment analysis.
  - Focus on a subset of top assets from each cluster, balancing between concentrated exposure and diversification.

---

**5. Limitations and Assumptions**

- **Limited Capital**: The approach assumes that capital is limited, so full diversification across 4000+ equities is not possible.
- **Market Conditions**: The clusters should be updated regularly (e.g., daily or weekly) to reflect changing market conditions.
- **Transaction Costs**: Consideration of transaction costs when rebalancing or adjusting the portfolio.

---

**6. Monitoring and Rebalancing**

- **Performance Tracking**: 
  - Monitor portfolio performance by tracking cluster performance and individual asset returns.
  
- **Rebalancing**: 
  - Rebalance the portfolio periodically (e.g., monthly) to maintain the desired cluster exposure and ensure that assets within each cluster are still performing in line with expectations.

---

**Conclusion**

By clustering equities into manageable groups and focusing on their collective characteristics rather than individual assets, you can build a portfolio that is well-diversified and optimized, even with limited capital. This approach provides a streamlined, data-driven method for tackling the complex problem of portfolio management and risk mitigation.
