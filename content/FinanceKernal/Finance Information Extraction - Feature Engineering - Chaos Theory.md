We moved beyond traditional **time-based bars** and implemented **event-driven bars** to extract **hidden market structures**:

1. **Volatility Bars** → Sampled bars when market volatility exceeded a threshold.
2. **Dollar Bars** → Sampled bars when **cumulative traded value** reached a set amount.
3. **Entropy-Based Bars** → Sampled bars based on **information content** (Shannon entropy).
4. **Neural Spike Bars** → Triggered bars when **momentum resembled neuron firings**.
5. **Fractal Bars** → Sampled bars based on **self-similarity patterns** (Hurst exponent).



We engineered **new financial features** from **signal processing, information theory, and nonlinear dynamics**:

- **Shannon Entropy** → Measures randomness in price movements.
- **Hurst Exponent** → Detects whether markets are **trending or mean-reverting**.
- **Wavelet Energy** → Captures **multi-scale price movement patterns**.
- **Momentum Spike Indicator** → Identifies **strong market moves**.
- **Cumulative Dollar Volume** → Tracks liquidity shifts.
