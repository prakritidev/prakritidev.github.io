Options trading strategies can be broadly categorized into **directional** (predicting price movement) and **non-directional** (benefiting from volatility, time decay, or specific market conditions). Here are some popular strategies used in the market:

  

**1. Directional Strategies**

  

These strategies are based on anticipating the underlying asset’s price movement (up or down).

  

**a. Long Call**

• **Outlook:** Bullish

• **Description:** Buy a call option to benefit from upward price movement.

• **Risk:** Limited to the premium paid.

• **Reward:** Unlimited (theoretically).

  

**b. Long Put**

• **Outlook:** Bearish

• **Description:** Buy a put option to profit from downward price movement.

• **Risk:** Limited to the premium paid.

• **Reward:** Substantial (price can drop to zero).

  

**c. Covered Call**

• **Outlook:** Neutral to mildly bullish.

• **Description:** Own the underlying asset and sell a call option to earn income.

• **Risk:** Limited upside (call cap) and full downside of the stock.

• **Reward:** Premium collected.

  

**d. Protective Put**

• **Outlook:** Bullish with downside protection.

• **Description:** Own the underlying asset and buy a put as insurance.

• **Risk:** Premium cost for the put.

• **Reward:** Unlimited upside minus the premium.

  

**2. Income Strategies (Neutral Market)**

  

These strategies generate income through time decay (Theta).

  

**a. Cash-Secured Put**

• **Outlook:** Neutral to bullish.

• **Description:** Sell a put option while holding cash to buy the stock if assigned.

• **Risk:** Downside is the strike price minus the premium.

• **Reward:** Premium collected.

  

**b. Iron Condor**

• **Outlook:** Neutral (range-bound market).

• **Description:** Combine a bull put spread and bear call spread to profit from low volatility.

• **Risk:** Limited to the difference between strikes minus the premium.

• **Reward:** Premium collected.

  

**c. Iron Butterfly**

• **Outlook:** Neutral.

• **Description:** Sell a straddle (short call + short put) and buy protective wings at different strikes.

• **Risk:** Limited to the difference between strikes.

• **Reward:** Premium collected.

  

**3. Volatility Strategies**

  

These strategies take advantage of high or low volatility expectations.

  

**a. Straddle**

• **Outlook:** Expecting high volatility (large price movement).

• **Description:** Buy both a call and put at the same strike price.

• **Risk:** Limited to the combined premium.

• **Reward:** Significant if the price moves sharply in either direction.

  

**b. Strangle**

• **Outlook:** Expecting high volatility (large movement, but unsure of direction).

• **Description:** Buy a call and a put at different strike prices.

• **Risk:** Limited to the combined premium.

• **Reward:** Substantial if the price moves beyond the breakeven points.

  

**c. Calendar Spread**

• **Outlook:** Expecting low volatility in the near term.

• **Description:** Sell a short-term option and buy a longer-term option at the same strike price.

• **Risk:** Limited to the net debit.

• **Reward:** Substantial if the stock price stays near the strike price.

  

**4. Hedging Strategies**

  

These reduce risk for existing positions.

  

**a. Collar**

• **Outlook:** Protective but limits upside.

• **Description:** Buy a put option and sell a call option at different strike prices.

• **Risk:** Downside limited by the put.

• **Reward:** Capped by the call.

  

**b. Ratio Spread**

• **Outlook:** Mildly bullish or bearish.

• **Description:** Sell more options than you buy (e.g., sell 2 calls and buy 1).

• **Risk:** Unlimited in certain setups.

• **Reward:** Premium collected.

  

**5. Advanced Strategies**

  

These involve complex multi-leg positions for specific outcomes.

  

**a. Diagonal Spread**

• **Outlook:** Moderate movement and specific time horizon.

• **Description:** Buy a long-term option and sell a short-term option at different strikes.

• **Risk:** Limited to the initial debit.

• **Reward:** Can be substantial with proper timing.

  

**b. Jade Lizard**

• **Description:** Combine a short put and short call spread to avoid upside risk.

• **Risk:** Downside only from the short put.

• **Reward:** Premium collected.

  

**c. Box Spread**

• **Outlook:** Arbitrage or capital guarantee.

• **Description:** Combine a bull call spread and bear put spread to lock in risk-free profit.

• **Risk:** Minimal (execution-related).

• **Reward:** Risk-free return minus commissions.

  

**6. Earnings and Event-Driven Strategies**

• **Straddle/Strangle:** For earnings announcements or major events where large price moves are expected.

• **Reverse Iron Condor:** For expected volatility spikes.

  

**Key Factors in Strategy Selection**

1. **Market View:**
