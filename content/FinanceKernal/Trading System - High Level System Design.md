Great! Here’s how we can structure the system design at a high level with those components in mind:

### **High-Level System Design**

#### **Key Components**
1. **Data Ingestion Layer**:
   - **MinIO**: For object storage, replacing AWS S3 during development and for backup storage.
   - **Airflow**: For orchestrating the entire data pipeline—handling the movement and processing of data across components, including feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

2. **Data Storage and Feature Management**:
   - **Feature Store (Feast)**: To store and serve features required for training and real-time inference. It can manage both historical features and real-time features, and keep track of feature lineage.
   - **MinIO**: Will be used as a backup storage solution for saving datasets, models, and logs.
   - **Database**: An RDBMS or NoSQL database (such as MongoDB) for holding metadata, models, and portfolio information.
   
3. **Model Training and Experimentation**:
   - **MLflow**: To track experiments, log parameters, metrics, and models, and to serve models for inference.
   - **Jupyter Notebooks**: For initial model development and experimentation, integrated with MLflow for logging.

4. **Model Serving**:
   - **Docker Containers**: For packaging the models and services as self-contained units, ensuring reproducibility, and making deployment easier.
   - **FastAPI/Flask**: For creating APIs for model inference, portfolio optimization, and other services like data processing.

5. **Data Analytics and Visualization**:
   - **Apache Superset**: For real-time visualization and dashboarding, giving you insights into market data, portfolio performance, clustering, and risk analysis.

6. **Compute and Orchestration**:
   - **Docker**: Containerizing the applications (Airflow, MLflow, APIs, etc.) and running them on local machines or cloud instances.
   - **Docker Swarm**: For local orchestration of services when scaling out, handling load balancing and service discovery.

7. **Messaging/Queue System**:
   - **RabbitMQ or Kafka**: For asynchronous communication between different services (e.g., triggering model retraining or updating portfolio weights).

8. **Real-Time Data Processing**:
   - **Airflow**: Orchestrating the movement of data from external sources to MinIO and triggering feature engineering and model retraining.
   - **Real-time Event Processing**: Use Airflow tasks to trigger actions when new market data is received.

9. **API Layer**:
   - **FastAPI/Flask**: Expose endpoints for model inference, portfolio updates, and other critical functionalities.
   - **API Contracts**: Standardized contracts defining input data (OHLCV, features, etc.), request and response formats (JSON, arrays of values, etc.).

---

### **Component Communication & Data Flow**:

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - External market data is collected by scraping or via APIs.
   - Data is stored in MinIO (object storage) or a database.
   - Airflow schedules the data pipelines to ensure continuous data collection.

2. **Feature Engineering & Storage**:
   - Airflow tasks trigger feature engineering jobs, feeding data from MinIO into the Feature Store (Feast).
   - Feature Store serves both historical and real-time features.
   - Processed features are stored in the Feature Store, and new features are logged in MLflow.

3. **Model Training & Experimentation**:
   - MLflow tracks models and experiments, logging hyperparameters, metrics, and final models.
   - Training jobs are executed in containers, and results are logged in MLflow.

4. **Model Deployment & Serving**:
   - Docker containers are used to serve models through FastAPI or Flask.
   - Models are queried by the portfolio management system for real-time inference.

5. **Real-time Processing**:
   - Kafka or RabbitMQ will handle real-time data ingestion and event-driven processing.
   - For example, if a new stock price is available, it will trigger model inference and portfolio updates.

6. **Orchestration & Monitoring**:
   - Airflow manages the pipeline orchestration and monitors task success/failure.
   - Apache Superset provides visualizations of portfolio performance, stock clustering, and risk analytics.

### **API Contracts**:

1. **Data Ingestion API**:
   - **POST /api/data**: Receives raw stock data (OHLCV, technical indicators, etc.).
   - **Request**: `{ "symbol": "AAPL", "date": "2024-11-15", "open": 145.2, "high": 146.8, "low": 144.0, "close": 145.7, "volume": 10000 }`
   - **Response**: `{ "status": "success", "message": "Data stored successfully" }`

2. **Model Inference API**:
   - **POST /api/predict**: Receives stock data for prediction.
   - **Request**: `{ "symbol": "AAPL", "features": [0.01, -0.02, 0.03] }`
   - **Response**: `{ "prediction": 0.02, "confidence": 0.85 }`

3. **Portfolio Update API**:
   - **POST /api/portfolio/update**: Receives the new portfolio weights.
   - **Request**: `{ "weights": { "AAPL": 0.25, "GOOG": 0.35, "TSLA": 0.4 } }`
   - **Response**: `{ "status": "success", "message": "Portfolio updated successfully" }`

4. **Model Management API**:
   - **GET /api/model/{model_id}**: Fetches the current model.
   - **Response**: `{ "model_id": "abc123", "status": "deployed", "last_updated": "2024-11-15" }`

### **Detailed Explanation of the Flow**

1. **External Market Data Source**:
   - **Input**: Market data from external sources, such as stock price feeds or cryptocurrency data APIs.
   - **Output**: Raw market data in the form of OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume), technical indicators, and possibly alternative data sources.

2. **Data Ingestion Layer (Airflow, Kafka, SQS)**:
   - **Airflow**: Orchestrates all the data pipelines. Airflow will schedule and trigger jobs for data ingestion and processing.
   - **Kafka/SQS**: These are used for real-time message passing. Whenever new data arrives, Kafka/SQS will notify the system to trigger data processing workflows.

3. **Data Storage Layer (MinIO, MongoDB, SQL DB)**:
   - **MinIO**: Stores raw market data, processed data, feature engineering outputs, and model files as backup storage.
   - **MongoDB/SQL DB**: Used for structured data storage, such as feature store metadata, model metadata, and portfolio information.

4. **Feature Engineering & Management Layer (Feast, Feature Store, Airflow, MLflow)**:
   - **Feast**: Manages both real-time and historical features required for model training and inference. Feast ensures feature consistency across different models and pipelines.
   - **Airflow**: Orchestrates feature extraction jobs, triggers feature pipelines whenever new data comes in, and feeds it to Feast.
   - **MLflow**: Logs all feature engineering steps and tracks the lineage of features.

5. **Model Training & Experimentation Layer (MLflow, Docker, Jupyter, Hyperparameter)**:
   - **MLflow**: Logs experiments, tracks hyperparameters, and stores model artifacts.
   - **Docker**: Containerizes training jobs to ensure reproducibility and easy scaling. Docker allows you to run models in isolated environments.
   - **Jupyter**: Used for interactive experimentation, model development, and tuning.

6. **Model Deployment and Serving Layer (Docker, FastAPI, Flask, MLflow API)**:
   - **Docker**: Once a model is trained, it is containerized using Docker, allowing for easy deployment to production.
   - **FastAPI/Flask**: Exposes the model inference API. FastAPI (for speed) or Flask (for flexibility) serve the model in real-time for portfolio management and decision-making.
   - **MLflow API**: If necessary, MLflow can serve the models via its API for real-time inference and also manage multiple versions of models.

7. **Portfolio Management & Trading Execution Layer**:
   - **Model Inference**: Inference from the trained models is used to make trading decisions based on the portfolio's performance, predictions, and risk analysis.
   - **Backtesting**: Historical data is used to evaluate the model’s performance on past data.
   - **Risk Analysis**: Ensures that the trading system adheres to risk management protocols, including diversification, position sizing, and stop-loss mechanisms.

8. **Visualization & Analytics Layer (Superset, Dashboards)**:
   - **Superset**: Allows you to create interactive dashboards for real-time tracking of your portfolio performance, model accuracy, and market data.
   - **Real-time Alerts**: Alerts on important changes, like a significant drop in portfolio value or a change in market conditions.

### **Data Flow Example**

#### **Step-by-Step Data Flow**:

1. **Step 1: Data Ingestion**
   - Market data from APIs (stocks, crypto) is fetched and stored in MinIO as raw data (OHLCV).
   - Kafka or SQS queues message the system about new data arrival.

2. **Step 2: Feature Engineering**
   - Airflow schedules jobs to run periodically to process raw data and extract technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, MACD).
   - Processed data is then ingested into Feast to serve as features for training and inference.

3. **Step 3: Model Training**
   - MLflow tracks all experiments, logging metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall for each model.
   - Docker containers are used to train models in isolated environments to ensure reproducibility.
   - After training, the model is stored and logged in MLflow.

4. **Step 4: Model Deployment**
   - The best-performing model is deployed as a Docker container with FastAPI or Flask serving the inference API.
   - The portfolio management system sends market data to the model for predictions.

5. **Step 5: Portfolio Management & Trading Execution**
   - The model outputs buy/sell/hold signals based on its predictions (price movements, volatility, etc.).
   - The trading algorithm takes those signals and places trades using an API to a broker or exchange.

6. **Step 6: Real-Time Monitoring & Analytics**
   - Superset is used to create dashboards that track the portfolio’s performance, providing visual insights.
   - Alerts notify the system in case of critical changes (e.g., portfolio drawdown or market anomalies).
