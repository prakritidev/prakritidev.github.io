**1. Data Preparation**

  

**1.1. Gather Data**

• Ensure you have OHLCV data for all 5000 stocks over the same time period.

• Store data in a structured format (e.g., Pandas DataFrame, CSV files, or databases).

  

**1.2. Data Preprocessing**

• **Handling Missing Values:**

• Use forward-fill, backward-fill, or interpolation for minor gaps.

• For significant gaps, drop the stock or time window.

• **Normalization:**

• Normalize prices and volume data to make them comparable.

• Common methods:

• **Min-Max Scaling:** Scale data to [0, 1].

• **Z-Score Normalization:** Scale data to zero mean and unit variance.

• Log transformation for volume (to reduce skewness).

• **Feature Selection:**

• Use derived features:

• Log returns: .

• Moving averages or RSI (Relative Strength Index) for trends.

• Volatility measures (e.g., rolling standard deviation).

  

**1.3. Synchronization**

• Align all stocks to the same timestamps.

• Handle timezone or holiday differences (e.g., exclude non-trading days).

  

**2. Feature Engineering**

  

**2.1. Extract Key Features**

  

You can use the following subsets or combinations:

• **OHLC Time Series:** Normalize and cluster the entire price series.

• **Derived Metrics:** Cluster based on:

• **Returns:** Daily or weekly returns for trends.

• **Volatility:** Rolling standard deviation or ATR (Average True Range).

• **Volume Trends:** Rolling volume changes or VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price).

  

**2.2. Dimensionality Reduction**

  

For high-dimensional data (e.g., 5000 stocks, 252 trading days per year):

• **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):** Retain dominant patterns.

• **Autoencoders:** Use deep learning to compress time series into lower-dimensional embeddings.

  

**3. Choosing Similarity Measures**

  

**3.1. General Trends**

• Use **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW):**

• Allows for phase shifts (e.g., stocks reacting at different times to news).

• Use tslearn.metrics.dtw or fastdtw.

  

**3.2. Co-Movement Patterns**

• Use **Correlation-Based Distance:**

• Compute pairwise correlations of returns.

• Use as the distance metric.

• Example:

  

import numpy as np

correlation_matrix = np.corrcoef(return_data.T)

distance_matrix = 1 - correlation_matrix

  

  

  

**3.3. Shape-Based Methods**

• Segment data into meaningful shapes (e.g., SAX representation from pyts).

• Compare based on symbolic similarity.

  

**4. Clustering**

  

**4.1. Select Clustering Algorithm**

• **k-Means with DTW:** Suitable for large datasets with fixed cluster numbers.

• **Hierarchical Clustering:** Useful for dendrogram analysis.

• **DBSCAN or HDBSCAN:** For discovering clusters with arbitrary shapes and handling noise.

• **Ensemble Methods:** Combine multiple clustering results for robust grouping.

  

**4.2. Implementation**

  

Example: Using k-Means with DTW:

  

from tslearn.clustering import TimeSeriesKMeans

from tslearn.metrics import dtw

  

_# Assuming `time_series_data` is your preprocessed dataset_

model = TimeSeriesKMeans(n_clusters=10, metric="dtw")

labels = model.fit_predict(time_series_data)

  

**5. Evaluation and Visualization**

  

**5.1. Evaluate Clusters**

• **Internal Validation Metrics:**

• Silhouette Score.

• Davies-Bouldin Index.

• **External Metrics (if labels available):**

• Adjusted Rand Index (ARI).

  

**5.2. Visualize Results**

• **Cluster Prototypes:** Plot representative time series for each cluster.

• **Heatmaps:** Show similarity/distance matrices.

• **Dendrograms:** For hierarchical clustering.

  

**6. Potential Fallbacks and Solutions**

  

**6.1. Large Data Volume**

• **Challenge:** Clustering 5000 time series can be computationally expensive.

• **Solution:**

• Use dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) before clustering.

• Parallelize computations (e.g., with joblib or GPU-based libraries).

  

**6.2. Heterogeneous Time Series Length**

• **Challenge:** Some stocks may have incomplete data.

• **Solution:** Use DTW or truncate/pad time series to the same length.

  

**6.3. Sensitivity to Noise**

• **Challenge:** Stock market data can be noisy.

• **Solution:** Use smoothing techniques like moving averages or filter outliers.

  

**6.4. Overfitting in DTW**

• **Challenge:** DTW can align noise instead of meaningful trends.

• **Solution:** Apply smoothing or use weighted DTW to prioritize global trends.

  

**7. Using OHLCV Data Specifically**

• Create multiple clustering pipelines for specific objectives:

1. **Price-Based Clustering:** Use normalized OHLC data.

2. **Volatility-Based Clustering:** Use rolling volatility or ATR.

3. **Volume-Based Clustering:** Identify high-volume movers.

• Combine results using ensemble clustering or rank-based aggregation to identify overall patterns.

  
```
import numpy as np

import pandas as pd

from tslearn.clustering import TimeSeriesKMeans

from tslearn.metrics import dtw

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

  

_# Load OHLCV data_

data = pd.read_csv("ohlcv_data.csv")  _# Rows: Timestamps, Columns: Stock OHLCV_

  

_# Step 1: Preprocess Data_

data["log_return"] = np.log(data["Close"] / data["Close"].shift(1)).fillna(0)

normalized_data = StandardScaler().fit_transform(data["log_return"].values.reshape(-1, 1))

  

_# Step 2: Feature Engineering_

_# Use rolling features (e.g., moving averages, volatility)_

data["volatility"] = data["Close"].rolling(window=10).std()

  

_# Step 3: Dimensionality Reduction_

pca = PCA(n_components=10)

compressed_data = pca.fit_transform(normalized_data)

  

_# Step 4: Clustering with DTW_

model = TimeSeriesKMeans(n_clusters=10, metric="dtw")

labels = model.fit_predict(compressed_data)

  

_# Step 5: Analyze and Visualize_

print("Cluster Assignments:", labels)

  
```


# Preprocessing things

**1. Essential Preprocessing Steps for DTW**

  

These steps are critical to ensure that DTW operates on clean, comparable time series data.

  

**1.1. Handling Missing Data**

• **Why:** DTW requires complete time series to compute distances.

• **How:**

• Interpolate missing values (linear, spline, or nearest neighbor).

• Forward-fill/backward-fill for gaps.

• Drop stocks with excessive missing values.

  

**1.2. Normalization**

• **Why:** DTW is sensitive to the scale of values. Normalization ensures fair comparison across stocks.

• **How:**

• **Min-Max Scaling:** Scale all values to [0, 1].

• **Z-Score Standardization:** Subtract mean and divide by standard deviation for each time series.

  

**1.3. Smoothing**

• **Why:** Stock data is noisy. Smoothing reduces the impact of random fluctuations.

• **How:**

• Apply a rolling mean or median (e.g., a 5-day moving average).

• Use exponential smoothing for a more responsive approach to recent values.

  

**1.4. Length Alignment**

• **Why:** DTW allows for different lengths, but extreme variations in length can distort alignment.

• **How:**

• Truncate time series to a fixed length.

• Pad shorter series with zeros or the mean value.

  

**2. Advanced Transformations**

  

These transformations may improve the quality of clustering depending on your objectives.

  

**2.1. Differencing**

• **Why:** Removes trends and focuses on changes, making patterns more comparable.

• **How:**

• Compute first-order differences: .

• Optionally use second-order differences for more complex patterns.

  

**2.2. Log Transformation**

• **Why:** Reduces the impact of large spikes (e.g., extreme price changes) and stabilizes variance.

• **How:**

• Apply , where is a small constant to handle zeros.

  

**2.3. Time Series Decomposition**

• **Why:** Decomposition separates a time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components. This helps if you want to focus on specific patterns.

• **When to Decompose:**

• If your goal is to compare trends or residuals separately.

• For highly seasonal stocks or when noise obscures patterns.

  

**How to Decompose:**

  

Use libraries like statsmodels or seasonal to perform decomposition:

  

from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose

  

result = seasonal_decompose(time_series, model='additive', period=252)  _# 252 trading days_

trend = result.trend

seasonal = result.seasonal

residual = result.resid

  

Decide which component(s) to use for DTW:

• **Trend:** For long-term comparisons.

• **Residual:** For pattern-based clustering.

• **Seasonal:** If you expect stocks to behave similarly in cycles (e.g., quarterly performance).

  

**3. Feature Engineering**

  

Additional transformations can emphasize patterns of interest.

  

**3.1. Rolling Statistics**

• Compute rolling means, medians, or volatility (e.g., standard deviation over a 10-day window).

• Example:

  

data['rolling_mean'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()

data['rolling_std'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=10).std()

  

**3.2. Aggregation**

• Aggregate data into different time scales (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).

• Useful if daily data is too noisy or if long-term trends are more important.

  

**3.3. Feature Scaling Across Time Series**

• Scale all time series together (global normalization) if relative differences between stocks matter.

  

**4. Decision: Should You Decompose?**

• **Yes, Decompose If:**

• You want to analyze specific components (e.g., trend or residuals).

• The time series has strong seasonality or noise obscuring patterns.

• Clustering objectives focus on identifying long-term behavior or separating noise.

• **No, Decomposition May Not Be Necessary If:**

• You’re analyzing overall similarity.

• Patterns are already clear after basic preprocessing.

  

**5. Handling Potential Fallbacks**

1. **Scaling Mismatches:** Normalize or rescale to avoid outlier bias.

2. **Noise Sensitivity:** Apply smoothing or decomposition to isolate meaningful components.

3. **Computational Cost:** For large datasets, downsample or use approximate DTW algorithms like fastdtw.

  

**Example Pipeline for Preprocessing and DTW**

  

import numpy as np

from tslearn.metrics import dtw

from tslearn.preprocessing import TimeSeriesScalerMeanVariance

from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose

import pandas as pd

  

_# Step 1: Load Data_

data = pd.read_csv("ohlcv_data.csv")  _# Assume 'Close' is the target series_

  

_# Step 2: Preprocessing_

_# Normalize_

scaler = TimeSeriesScalerMeanVariance()

normalized_data = scaler.fit_transform(data['Close'].values.reshape(-1, 1))

  

_# Smooth (Rolling Mean)_

data['smoothed'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=5).mean()

  

_# Optional: Decompose_

result = seasonal_decompose(data['smoothed'], model='additive', period=252)

trend = result.trend.dropna()

  

_# Step 3: DTW_

distance_matrix = np.array([[dtw(ts1, ts2) for ts2 in trend] for ts1 in trend])

  

**Summary of Required Transformations**

1. Normalize (Min-Max or Z-Score).

2. Handle missing values (interpolation or removal).

3. Smooth data to reduce noise.

4. Align lengths or truncate/pad as needed.

5. Optionally decompose to isolate trends, seasonality, or residuals.

  

# Things to look out for.
  

**End-to-End Process for Clustering Stocks**

  

**1. Define the Objective**

• **Goal:** Group stocks into clusters for representation and diversification.

• **Criteria:**

• Clusters should reflect stocks with similar risk/return or price movement patterns.

• Stocks within a cluster should avoid redundancy, ensuring meaningful diversification.

  

**2. Data Preparation**

  

This stage is critical for ensuring high-quality input data.

  

**2.1. Data Collection**

• Collect OHLCV data for all 5000 stocks.

• **Metrics to Calculate:**

• **Price-Based Features:** Closing prices, log returns, volatility.

• **Volume-Based Features:** Average daily volume, changes in volume.

• **Technical Indicators:** RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.

  

**2.2. Data Cleaning**

• **Potential Errors:**

• **Missing Data:** Gaps in price or volume data.

• **Solution:** Interpolate missing values or drop incomplete data.

• **Outliers:** Sudden spikes/drops due to errors or rare events.

• **Solution:** Winsorize or use robust statistical methods to handle outliers.

  

**2.3. Feature Scaling**

• Normalize or standardize features.

• **Error to Watch:** Inconsistent scaling across stocks leads to biased clustering.

• **Solution:** Use global normalization (e.g., Z-score scaling across all stocks).

  

**2.4. Align Time Frames**

• Ensure all stocks have data for the same time period.

• **Error to Watch:** Different lengths of time series (e.g., newly listed stocks).

• **Solution:** Truncate or pad shorter time series.

  

**2.5. Denoising**

• Apply smoothing to reduce noise (e.g., moving averages or exponential smoothing).

• **Error to Watch:** Over-smoothing may remove meaningful signals.

• **Solution:** Use a moderate smoothing window (e.g., 5–10 days).

  

**3. Feature Engineering**

  

**3.1. Statistics-Based Features**

• Compute summary statistics for clustering:

• Mean log returns, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis.

• Rolling features (e.g., 15-day mean return, 15-day volatility).

  

**3.2. Time Series Features**

• Use raw price series or log returns for DTW or correlation-based clustering.

• **Error to Watch:** Overemphasis on high-volatility stocks in similarity metrics.

• **Solution:** Normalize time series before applying similarity measures.

  

**3.3. Technical Indicators**

• Calculate indicators like RSI, MACD, or moving averages.

• **Error to Watch:** Redundant or correlated features.

• **Solution:** Use PCA or feature selection to reduce dimensionality.

  

**4. Clustering**

  

**4.1. Statistics-Based Clustering**

• **Algorithm:** k-Means, DBSCAN, or Gaussian Mixture Models.

• **Steps:**

• Use features like mean return, variance, and kurtosis.

• Identify the optimal number of clusters using:

• Elbow method (for k-Means).

• Silhouette score (for all methods).

• Visualize clusters in 2D using t-SNE or PCA.

• **Error to Watch:**

• Poorly separated clusters due to high-dimensional data


# Features that might be useful

**Automated Feature Selection**

• Use algorithms like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) or AutoML tools to automate feature selection.

  

**Dynamic Feature Sets**

• Adjust feature importance dynamically based on market conditions (e.g., using regime-switching models).

  

**6. Sample Implementation**

  

Here’s a Python snippet for feature engineering:

  

import pandas as pd

import numpy as np

from scipy.stats import skew, kurtosis

  

_# Load data_

data = pd.read_csv("stock_data.csv")

returns = data.pivot(index="Date", columns="Stock", values="Close").pct_change()

  

_# Rolling metrics_

window = 15

features = pd.DataFrame()

features['mean_return'] = returns.rolling(window=window).mean().mean(axis=1)

features['volatility'] = returns.rolling(window=window).std().mean(axis=1)

features['skewness'] = returns.rolling(window=window).apply(skew).mean(axis=1)

features['kurtosis'] = returns.rolling(window=window).apply(kurtosis).mean(axis=1)

  

_# Performance ratios_

risk_free_rate = 0.01 / 252  _# Annualized to daily_

features['sharpe_ratio'] = (features['mean_return'] - risk_free_rate) / features['volatility']

  

_# Normalize_

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

• Use silhouette scores or visualization (e.g., t-SNE).

2. **Experiment with Different Features:**

• Combine risk, return, and technical indicators.

3. **Iterate:**

• Continuously refine based on clustering performance and backtesting results.


# Risk Return profile 
If your goal is to cluster stocks based on **similar risk-return profiles**, here’s an in-depth approach tailored to your objective.

  

**1. What is a Risk-Return Profile?**

  

A stock’s risk-return profile captures:

1. **Return:** Measures the average return over a period (e.g., 15–30 days).

2. **Risk:** Measures the variability (volatility) of returns.

3. **Higher-Order Risk Metrics:** Skewness, kurtosis, and tail risks to capture unusual behaviors.

4. **Other Considerations:** Downside risk, Sharpe ratio, and historical drawdowns.

  

**2. Workflow for Clustering Based on Risk-Return Profiles**

  

**Step 1: Data Preparation**

  

**1.1. Time Frame**

• Focus on a rolling window of **15–30 days** to align with your target horizon.

• If using long-term historical data, calculate rolling statistics for short-term returns and risk.

  

**1.2. Return Calculation**

• Use **log returns** for robust comparisons:

• Compute rolling metrics:

• **Mean Log Return** over 15 or 30 days.

• **Standard Deviation (Volatility)** of returns over the same period.

  

**1.3. Risk Metrics**

• **Higher-Order Statistics:**

• **Skewness:** Asymmetry of return distribution (positive indicates higher likelihood of gains).

• **Kurtosis:** Extreme movements (higher kurtosis indicates more outliers).

• **Downside Risk:** Focus on negative returns using semi-deviation or Sortino ratio.

• **Drawdowns:** Maximum percentage decline from a peak during a rolling window.

  

**Step 2: Feature Engineering**

  

The features should comprehensively represent risk-return profiles:

• **Returns:**

• Average return (mean log return).

• Rolling cumulative return over 15–30 days.

• **Risk:**

• Rolling standard deviation of returns (volatility).

• Downside deviation.

• Beta (sensitivity to market movements).

• **Performance Ratios:**

• Sharpe ratio:

• Sortino ratio: Penalizes downside risk more heavily.

• **Tail Risk:**

• Skewness and kurtosis of return distribution.

  

**Step 3: Clustering**

  

**3.1. Select Clustering Algorithm**

• Use clustering algorithms that handle mixed feature spaces (numerical and statistical metrics):

• **k-Means:** Works well for standardized numerical features.

• **DBSCAN:** Identifies clusters of arbitrary shapes and outliers.

• **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):** Clusters based on probabilistic distributions.

• **Agglomerative Clustering:** Good for hierarchical relationships.

  

**3.2. Preprocessing**

• Normalize or standardize all features to ensure they contribute equally:

  

**3.3. Determine the Number of Clusters**

• Use methods like:

• **Elbow Method:** Plot inertia (sum of squared distances) versus the number of clusters.

• **Silhouette Score:** Measures separation between clusters.

  

**Step 4: Stock Selection for Diversification**

1. **Representative Stocks:**

• Pick one stock from each cluster based on criteria like lowest volatility or highest Sharpe ratio.

2. **Diversification Check:**

• Ensure clusters are distinct in terms of risk-return characteristics by plotting key metrics (e.g., mean return vs. volatility).

  

**3. Example Pipeline**

  

Here’s how you can implement this in Python:

  

import pandas as pd

import numpy as np

from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

from scipy.stats import skew, kurtosis

  

_# Step 1: Load Data_

data = pd.read_csv("stock_data.csv")  _# OHLCV data_

returns = data.pivot_table(index='Date', columns='Stock', values='Close').pct_change()

  

_# Step 2: Compute Risk-Return Metrics_

rolling_window = 15

features = pd.DataFrame()

  

_# Mean Return_

features['mean_return'] = returns.rolling(window=rolling_window).mean().mean(axis=1)

  

_# Volatility (Standard Deviation)_

features['volatility'] = returns.rolling(window=rolling_window).std().mean(axis=1)

  

_# Skewness_

features['skewness'] = returns.rolling(window=rolling_window).apply(skew).mean(axis=1)

  

_# Kurtosis_

features['kurtosis'] = returns.rolling(window=rolling_window).apply(kurtosis).mean(axis=1)

  

_# Step 3: Preprocessing_

scaler = StandardScaler()

scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(features.dropna())

  

_# Step 4: Clustering_

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=42)

clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(scaled_features)

features['cluster'] = clusters

  

_# Step 5: Analyze and Select Stocks_

_# Group by clusters and find representative stocks_

representative_stocks = returns.groupby(features['cluster']).apply(

    lambda x: x.idxmin(axis=1)  _# Example: Pick stock with lowest volatility_

)

  

**4. Errors and Pitfalls to Watch For**

1. **High Dimensionality:**

• Too many features dilute clustering quality.

• **Solution:** Use dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) to retain the most important features.

2. **Overlapping Clusters:**

• Stocks may not cleanly fall into distinct clusters.

• **Solution:** Use soft clustering methods (e.g., GMM) to handle overlaps.

3. **Outliers and Noise:**

• Extreme returns or atypical stocks can skew clusters.

• **Solution:** Apply robust methods (e.g., DBSCAN) or Winsorize extreme values.

4. **Feature Selection Bias:**

• Poorly chosen features might miss key patterns.

• **Solution:** Experiment with different combinations of risk-return metrics.

5. **Temporal Instability:**

• Clusters based on short-term data may not generalize.

• **Solution:** Use rolling windows to validate consistency.

  

**5. Visualization**

  

After clustering, visualize clusters to confirm separability:

• **Scatter Plots:**

• Plot mean return vs. volatility, colored by cluster.

• **Cluster Centroids:**

• Compare centroids to understand cluster profiles.

• **Time Series Plots:**

• Overlay representative stocks from each cluster.

  

**6. Advanced Extensions**

1. **Dynamic Clustering:**

• Update clusters periodically as new data becomes available.

2. **Hybrid Clustering:**

• Combine statistics-based clustering with time series similarity measures.

3. **Portfolio Optimization:**

• Use the clusters to select a diversified portfolio with constraints like maximum volatility.

# Risk Return Profile In depth

**Risk-Return Profile: A Comprehensive Guide**

  

The **risk-return profile** approach seeks to group stocks or assets based on their ability to balance returns and risk, tailoring it to your desired rebalancing timeline of 7–15 days. Here’s a deep dive into how you can implement this strategy effectively.

  

**1. Understanding Risk and Return Metrics**

  

**1.1 Return Metrics**

• **Mean Return (Short-Term):**

• Measures the average return over the desired period (e.g., 7 or 15 days).

• Formula:

where is the return on day .

• **Cumulative Return:**

• Measures total return over a fixed period.

where and are prices at the start and end of the period.

• **Rolling Returns:**

• Calculates returns over a moving window (e.g., every 15 days).

  

**1.2 Risk Metrics**

• **Volatility (Standard Deviation):**

• Quantifies daily return fluctuations.

• **Maximum Drawdown (MDD):**

• Captures the largest peak-to-trough loss during the period.

• **Value at Risk (VaR):**

• Estimates the potential loss in value under normal market conditions.

• **Beta:**

• Measures sensitivity to market movements. A lower beta reduces market exposure.

  

**1.3 Risk-Adjusted Return Metrics**

• **Sharpe Ratio:**

• Measures return per unit of risk. Higher is better.

where is the risk-free rate.

• **Sortino Ratio:**

• Similar to Sharpe but penalizes only downside volatility.

• **Treynor Ratio:**

• Focuses on systematic risk using beta.

  

**2. Key Steps in Risk-Return Optimization**

  

**Step 1: Feature Engineering**

  

Create features that capture risk-return metrics for each stock:

• **Return-Based Features:**

• Rolling mean return, cumulative return, 7-day and 15-day return.

• **Risk-Based Features:**

• Rolling volatility, beta, and max drawdown.

• **Risk-Adjusted Features:**

• Sharpe and Sortino ratios.

  

**Step 2: Normalize and Scale Features**

  

Standardize features to ensure comparability:

• Mean-center and scale using Z-scores:

  

**Step 3: Clustering Stocks**

• Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., **k-means**, **DBSCAN**, or **hierarchical clustering**) using the engineered features.

• Choose the number of clusters based on metrics like the **silhouette score** or **elbow method**.

  

**Step 4: Portfolio Construction**

• Select stocks from different clusters to ensure diversification.

• Optimize weights using mean-variance optimization (e.g., **Markowitz Portfolio Theory**) or **Risk Parity**.

  

**Step 5: Backtesting and Rebalancing**

• Backtest cluster performance over rolling 7–15 day windows.

• Rebalance periodically by re-evaluating clusters and portfolio weights.

  

**3. Portfolio Rebalancing: Why 7–15 Days?**

  

Short-term rebalancing aligns with your goal of capturing market opportunities while minimizing exposure. Here’s how this timeline works:

• **7-Day Rebalance:**

• Captures short-term price movements and trends.

• Suitable for volatile markets or event-driven strategies.

• **15-Day Rebalance:**

• Provides a balance between transaction costs and capturing medium-term trends.

  

**4. Implementation Workflow**

  

**Feature Engineering Workflow in Python**

  

import pandas as pd

import numpy as np

  

_# Load stock price data_

prices = pd.read_csv("stock_prices.csv")

returns = prices.pct_change()

  

_# Feature Engineering_

features = pd.DataFrame()

features['mean_return_7d'] = returns.rolling(window=7).mean()

features['volatility_7d'] = returns.rolling(window=7).std()

features['sharpe_ratio_7d'] = features['mean_return_7d'] / features['volatility_7d']

  

features['mean_return_15d'] = returns.rolling(window=15).mean()

features['volatility_15d'] = returns.rolling(window=15).std()

features['sharpe_ratio_15d'] = features['mean_return_15d'] / features['volatility_15d']

  

features = features.dropna()

  

**Clustering Workflow**

  

from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

  

_# Normalize features_

scaler = StandardScaler()

scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(features)

  

_# Apply k-means clustering_

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=42)

features['Cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(scaled_features)

  

_# Analyze clusters_

print(features.groupby('Cluster').mean())

  

**Portfolio Construction**

  

from pypfopt.efficient_frontier import EfficientFrontier

from pypfopt.risk_models import CovarianceShrinkage

from pypfopt.expected_returns import mean_historical_return

  

_# Calculate expected returns and covariance matrix_

expected_returns = mean_historical_return(prices)

cov_matrix = CovarianceShrinkage(prices).ledoit_wolf()

  

_# Optimize portfolio for maximum Sharpe ratio_

ef = EfficientFrontier(expected_returns, cov_matrix)

weights = ef.max_sharpe()

cleaned_weights = ef.clean_weights()

print(cleaned_weights)

  

**5. Common Challenges to Address**

  

**5.1 Overfitting Clusters**

• Avoid overly complex features or too many clusters.

• **Solution:** Use cross-validation to test cluster robustness.

  

**5.2 Transaction Costs**

• Frequent rebalancing increases costs.

• **Solution:** Limit turnover by capping stock weight changes.

  

**5.3 Changing Market Regimes**

• Risk-return profiles can vary across market cycles.

• **Solution:** Monitor cluster consistency over different time periods.

  

**5.4 Outlier Impact**

• Sudden price spikes can distort metrics.

• **Solution:** Winsorize returns to cap extreme values.

  

**6. Advanced Tips**

1. **Combine Risk-Return and Event-Based Approaches:**

• Overlay event-driven insights (e.g., earnings sensitivity) on risk-return clusters.

2. **Dynamic Clustering:**

• Update clusters adaptively as new data arrives, especially during volatile periods.

3. **Factor Analysis:**

• Decompose returns into common factors (e.g., size, value) for deeper clustering insights.

For your goal of building a balanced portfolio with consistent weekly returns, here are some additional techniques and approaches to explore beyond traditional clustering:

  

**1. Portfolio Optimization**

  

**a. Mean-Variance Optimization**

• Identify portfolios with the highest return for a given level of risk (or vice versa).

• Explore concepts like the **Efficient Frontier** and **Sharpe Ratio Maximization**.

  

**b. Risk Parity**

• Allocate capital based on risk contribution rather than absolute returns.

• Balances exposure across assets with different volatilities.

  

**c. Targeted Weekly Return**

• Use optimization to find weights that maximize the likelihood of achieving a specific weekly return (10%).

  

**2. Advanced Clustering Techniques**

  

**a. Temporal Patterns Clustering**

• Identify stocks with similar trends or seasonalities in returns.

• Use **autoencoders** or **Dynamic Time Warping** for temporal pattern recognition.

  

**b. Hierarchical Clustering**

• Understand the hierarchical relationship between stocks or clusters.

• Helpful for visualizing groupings using **dendrograms**.

  

**c. Spectral Clustering**

• Use graph theory to find clusters based on similarity matrices.

• Effective for non-convex shapes in your data.

  

**3. Regime Analysis**

• Detect market regimes (bullish, bearish, volatile) and adapt your strategy accordingly.

• Use unsupervised methods like **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)** or **Clustering on Volatility Regimes**.

  

**4. Feature Selection for Portfolio Clustering**

• Beyond risk-reward, consider:

• **Liquidity**: Daily trading volume, bid-ask spread.

• **Momentum**: Positive or negative price trends.

• **Beta**: Sensitivity to the market index (e.g., Nifty50).

• **Sector Diversification**: Cluster based on sectors for diversification.

  

**5. Pair and Group Analysis**

  

**a. Pairs Trading**

• Identify pairs of stocks with historical price relationships for mean-reversion strategies.

• Use cointegration techniques or pairwise clustering.

  

**b. Group Hedging**

• Cluster negatively correlated stocks (e.g., Nifty50 and Gold) for hedging opportunities.

• Helps balance risk across uncorrelated asset groups.

  

**6. Simulation and Backtesting**

• **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Test various portfolio scenarios and returns.

• **Backtesting Framework**: Evaluate weekly rebalancing performance on historical data.

  

**7. Continuous Learning**

• Implement **online clustering** or **streaming algorithms** to adapt to changing market conditions dynamically.

• Examples include **Incremental K-Means** or **Time-Series Autoencoders**.
