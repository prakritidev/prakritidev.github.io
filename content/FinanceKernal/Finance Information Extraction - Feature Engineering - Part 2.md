### **1️⃣ Chaos Theory & Dynamical Systems (High Impact, Medium Feasibility)**

**Why?**

- Financial markets exhibit **chaotic behavior** rather than pure randomness.
- Methods like **Lyapunov Exponents, Fractal Dimension, and Strange Attractors** can help detect regime shifts **before they happen**.

📌 **What to implement first?**  
✅ **Lyapunov Exponents** – Measures market stability (high = chaotic regime, low = stable).  
✅ **Hurst Exponent** – Already on our list, great for trend vs. mean reversion detection.  
✅ **Fractal Dimension** – Captures complexity in price dynamics.

🔬 **Key Research Papers:**

- "Fractal Market Hypothesis and Financial Crisis" – Mandelbrot’s work on fractals.
- "Detecting Chaos in Financial Time Series" – Analyzing Lyapunov exponents in stock markets.

### **2️⃣ Quantum-Inspired Methods (High Potential, Medium-High Complexity)**

**Why?**

- **Quantum Computing & Tensor Networks** offer better **feature compression**, reducing noise and improving generalization.
- **Ising Models & Quantum Entanglement** can help **detect large-scale structural shifts** in the market.

📌 **What to implement first?**  
✅ **Tensor Network Compression** – Uses Quantum Tensor Networks to improve feature representation.  
✅ **Ising Model for Market Phases** – Detects **structural phase transitions** in financial markets.
