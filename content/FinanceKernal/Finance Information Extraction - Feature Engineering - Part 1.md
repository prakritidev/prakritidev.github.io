## **1. Signal Processing Perspective**

Many market behaviors can be viewed as **time series signals**. Applying signal processing techniques can reveal hidden patterns:

- **Fourier Transform & Spectral Analysis** – Identifies dominant market cycles and frequencies, similar to how sound waves are analyzed.
- **Wavelet Transforms** – Can detect **localized** price movements and anomalies, much like wavelet-based edge detection in images.
- **Hilbert Transform & Instantaneous Phase Analysis** – Helps track momentum shifts in a way similar to how electrical signals are analyzed.
- **Autocorrelation & Cross-Correlation** – Measures how price movements at different time scales relate to each other.
- **Filter-based Techniques (Kalman Filter, Butterworth Filters)** – Used to smooth or extract price trends while eliminating noise.

## **2. Biological Inspiration**

Biological systems are known for their adaptive and evolutionary behavior. Markets also evolve dynamically:

- **Neural Spiking Models** – Price changes could be modeled like neuron firings, helping to capture sudden price movements.
- **Homeostasis & Mean-Reversion Analysis** – Similar to how organisms maintain equilibrium, price series often return to their mean.
- **Biological Growth Models (Gompertz Curve, Logistic Growth)** – Can model how price moves in bubbles and crashes.
- **Epidemiological Models (SIR Models)** – Could be used to model information diffusion in markets.

## **3. Mathematical & Information Theory**

Mathematical structures provide robust ways to extract signals from OHLCV data:

- **Entropy & Information Theory (Shannon Entropy, Fisher Information)** – Measures how much "surprise" or uncertainty exists in price movements.
- **Fractal Geometry & Hurst Exponent** – Measures **long-term memory effects** in markets, indicating trends or mean-reverting behavior.
- **Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA)** – Detects repeating patterns in price dynamics.
- **Topological Data Analysis (Persistent Homology)** – Studies market structure from a shape-theoretic perspective.

## **4. Graph Theory & Network Science**

Viewing markets as networks enables unique feature extraction:

- **Order Book as a Graph** – Treating bid/ask price levels as nodes and transactions as edges reveals market microstructure.
- **Price Series as a Markov Chain** – Helps estimate transition probabilities between different market states.
- **Community Detection Algorithms (Louvain, Spectral Clustering)** – Identifies correlated asset clusters.

## **5. Philosophical & Cognitive Sciences**

Philosophical and cognitive models of decision-making may provide new perspectives:

- **Kantian Causality & Event-Driven Bars** – Investigates **structural causality** in market data, refining event-driven bar techniques.
- **Game Theory & Nash Equilibrium Analysis** – Models trading as an interactive game with competing rational agents.
- **Bayesian Reasoning & Cognitive Bias Models** – Captures how traders update beliefs in response to new information.

### **Application to OHLCV Data: New Event-Driven Bars**

Inspired by these concepts, we can extend **event-driven bars** beyond traditional methods:

1. **Entropy-Based Bars** – Sample bars dynamically based on information content in price movements.
2. **Neural Spike Bars** – Generate bars when price momentum resembles biological neuron firings.
3. **Network-Connected Bars** – Construct bars when significant transactions cluster together in network-space.
4. **Fractal Bars** – Sample bars based on market self-similarity patterns.
