**Why Use Separate Models for Large-Cap, Mid-Cap, and Small-Cap Stocks?**

1. **Distinct Market Behavior**:

• **Large-Cap Stocks**: Typically more stable, with movements influenced by macroeconomic factors, institutional flows, and global trends.

• **Mid-Cap Stocks**: Exhibit moderate volatility and are more sensitive to industry trends and company-specific developments.

• **Small-Cap Stocks**: Highly volatile, with movements driven by liquidity, speculation, and company fundamentals.

2. **Better Representation of Market Regimes**:

• Market regimes (bullish, bearish, sideways) can manifest differently in each segment. For example:

• Large-caps may trend sideways, while small-caps rally during a specific market condition.

• Large-caps may lag in recovery during a bullish regime compared to small-caps.

3. **Improved Model Accuracy**:

• Separate models can focus on patterns unique to each class, leading to better predictions and reduced noise.

4. **Tailored Strategies**:

• By identifying market regimes separately for each segment, you can deploy strategies that are optimized for the behavior of those specific stocks.

  

**How to Approach the Problem**

  

**Step 1: Preprocess the Data for Each Segment**

1. Split your dataset into three subsets: large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks.

2. Calculate segment-specific indicators for each subset:

• Aggregated metrics like average returns, volatility, and momentum for each class.

• Sector performance within each segment, if relevant.

• Breadth indicators (e.g., percentage of advancing stocks in the segment).

  

**Step 2: Build Segment-Specific Models**

1. **Large-Cap Model**:

• Focus on macroeconomic indicators, sector performance, and global market indices.

• Likely less volatile, so models like **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)** or **GARCH** may work well.

• Use Transformer-based models if capturing complex, long-term dependencies is critical.

2. **Mid-Cap Model**:

• Combine macroeconomic factors with industry-specific trends.

• Mid-caps often serve as a bridge, so clustering or ensemble approaches (e.g., Random Forest + XGBoost) might capture their nuances better.

3. **Small-Cap Model**:

• Focus more on sentiment analysis, liquidity, and speculative indicators.

• Use models like **Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)** or **LSTM-CNN hybrids**, which excel at handling volatile and non-linear patterns.

  

**Step 3: Train and Validate Models**

• Train each model separately on its respective data subset.

• Use features specific to the stock class dynamics:

• **Large-Cap**: Macro factors, index correlations, earnings trends.

• **Mid-Cap**: Industry-specific metrics, momentum.

• **Small-Cap**: Sentiment, liquidity, volatility.

  

**Step 4: Combine Outputs for Holistic Analysis**

1. After detecting market regimes for each segment, assess whether they align or diverge.

2. Combine results to classify the overall market regime:

• Use a weighted approach based on market cap or trading volume.

• Alternatively, treat the dominant regime (e.g., if two segments are bullish, classify the overall market as bullish).


**Which Model Should You Choose?**

• **HMM**: If interpretability and simplicity are critical, and you expect clear regime shifts.

• **GARCH**: If volatility is a key factor for identifying regimes, especially in short-term data.

• **TFT**: If you want a powerful, state-of-the-art model and have ample data and computational resources.

• **LSTM-CNN**: If you need to capture both long-term trends and short-term patterns and can handle the complexity.


# Next Steps TODOs

1. **Start Simple**:

• Begin with HMMs or GARCH for quick prototyping.

• Use them to establish a baseline for regime detection.

2. **Experiment with Deep Learning**:

• If your baseline models don’t perform well, experiment with TFT or LSTM-CNN hybrids.

• Start with smaller datasets and fewer features to control computational costs.

3. **Feature Engineering**:

• Incorporate key indicators like moving averages, volatility, and volume.

• For advanced models, consider external factors like macroeconomic data.

4. **Evaluation**:

• Validate models on historical data to check regime classification accuracy.

• Use metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score for classification tasks.
