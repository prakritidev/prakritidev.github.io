These notions often defy direct explanation; there isn't a single book that encapsulates them neatly. You may read a hundred books spanning philosophy, poetry, and art in pursuit of comprehension.

With this series, let's embark on an exploration of captivating topics and intriguing characters, particularly those who have piqued my curiosity within the confines of my workplace.
